>**Note:** I am having some problems with the orbits and the next few 
days will be focused on resolving issues before moving on to more planets
due to this as well as my limited knowledge of processing I suspect I will not
be able to make much progress in the next few days

Today I was able to finish looking for the real information on the planets I currently have 
and I scaled them down so they firt on my screen, I also added a background Image, the picture up
above this text is a preview of what I have right now. I was able to change the tilts of the planets and 
the ellipses, the next few days will be focused on making the orbits of the planet. After that I will try to
add more planets and maybe some extra features.
