Journal June Sixth

Today I began to try to change the speed of Jupiter and Saturn. It was taking a long time for even one revolution to happen so I
tried a different approach but that made the sim not work. The majority of this period was spent on trying to make the sim work again
after a while I was able to get it to work again. Unfortunately I was not able to do anything past that. I hope to ba able to do this 
tomorrow.
