Journal May Thirtieth
====

Today I added Jupiter and Saturn. The majority of the first period was spent trying to figure out what sizes and
distances I should use. I am still not fully satisfied but I feel that I am rather close to what I want.
The second period today was used trying to make the rings of saturn, I spent a rather long time trying to angle
the rings correctly and make sure they look right. I am also not done with this, I have an idea on what I could do
to make the rings look more realistic and I hope to be able to do it tommorow.
