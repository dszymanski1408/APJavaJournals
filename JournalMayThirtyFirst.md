Journal May Thirty First
=====

Today I set out to tweak some of the prototype settings I had arbitrarily set just for saturn to show up. While I am still not that satisfied
with the distance I think the scale is fine and I was able to make the rings around saturn a bit more dynamic and even though they do look a 
little out of place I am more happy with them then what I had in the beginning of today.
