Today I fixed the slight error I had in the previous build of the project,
I made all the planets show up and gave them random sizes and distances.
Additionally, I added ellipses which, I hope will represent the planets orbits.
I will continue to tweak the distances/sizes in hopes of reaching a more realistic version.
