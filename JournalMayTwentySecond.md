Today I was able to fix a problem I had with the positioning of the moons of mars, I was able to
add them and I updated everything but the speed (of orbit and of rotation) of the planets to be true
to life (scaled down because of physical limitations of the system). I was planning to add more planets 
but after research on the distances and sizes involved I am reconsidering. I might still do it 
if I find a way of scaling down the planets in a way I find satisfactory.
