Journal June Fifth
=====

Today I continued my work from friday, June second. I was able to get venus and mars to be correct, I have the moons and the outer gas
giants to do now. This takes a while because I have to wait for the simulation of the planet to do a full rotation so I can note the 
amount to milliseconds it takes for a full revolution to happed then use velocity formula to tweak the speed to be as close to 
real as possible. The time in the simulation is as if every millisecond in the sim was a second in real life, which is why the planets 
in the sim appear to move so quickly. I hope to be able to do Jupiter and Saturn tommorow.
