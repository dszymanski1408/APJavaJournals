Jounal June First
=====

Today I tweaked the distances of Jupiter and Saturn so that I am satisfied with how it looks. I
was also able to add Uranus and Neptune, I'm not sure whether to add plutp pr not seeing as it is 
technically a dwarf-planet in the kuiper belt. A next step for me will be to add some of the moons 
around the outer planets. Other then that a majority of my work is completed.
