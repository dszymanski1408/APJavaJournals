Journal May Sixteenth
=====

Today I was able to finalize the distances, orbits and sizes of the first 4 planets and the sun,
I was able to get a better handle of the speed of the planets. Most of my time was taken up by
figuring out the information about the orbits that I needed. I hope to be able to add more planets 
soon if not even tommorow. I also hope to embed a `.gif` file in my journal.
