Today I spent most of my time looking for the nessesary information I need to be able to add more planets as
I have decided to try to include the outer planets. I was also able to create a ring class for saturn and I hope
to be able to draw a ring around saturn. I will need to do some more work to preserve the scale of the planets 
while still having them be visible.
