Journal May Twelfth

While today it might not seem like I got a lot of work done, I did in fact progress quite a bit
I was able to figure out a way to rotate something alone a elliptical path. It will take a lot more 
work to correctly implement this into my work but it should work. I will try to apply it to multiple 
planets next time I am able to work on my project. All in all I was able to get closer to my goal of
making a semi-realistic solar system model.
