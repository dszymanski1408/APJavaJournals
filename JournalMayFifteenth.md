Today I was able to fix my orbital issue with a little bit of tweaking, I was also able to make
all the planets I currently have orbit as well. This is really good for my progress and I am rather
happy I was able to do something I thought would take me much more time to do so quickly. Next I will try to
make the orbits more realistic, I hope to be able to add more planets soon.
