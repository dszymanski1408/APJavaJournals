>I did not have enough time to embed a `.gif` preview of my running code due to the fact the screen capture program I use has been uninstalled
and installing it again would take a very long time

Today I set out to make the user able to change the center of the camera. I thought it would take me a very long time.
While it did take some time it did not take as much time as I thought it would and I was able to fix my problem using 
threads. Additionally I was able to create the layers of the planets using additional spheres inside the planets themselves.
Eventually I hope to be able to individualize the look of the inner layers of the planets and maybe even add layers to the moons.
