>Due to my absence on Friday I decided to do some work at home

I created a planet class and an added the images I need for the textures of the spheres,
I also reorganized the files into a more comprehensive format. Unfortunatly in the process of 
making the spheres visible I did not correctly use instances of the planets and so as of right
now nothing shows up in the program, however, the basis for everything is set up and the fix is pretty 
simple to do so the next time I wil be able to fix the code and it should work.
