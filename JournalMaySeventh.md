>Due to my absence on Friday I decided to do some work at home

I created a planet class and an added the images I need for the textures of the spheres,
I also reorganized the files into a more comprehensive format. I was able to use constructors 
and add numerous planets to an ArrayList and show them. At the moment only the sun shows up but that is a 
quick fix.
