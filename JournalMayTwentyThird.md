>Unfortunatly I did not have enough time to link the `.gif` image today, maybe tommorow I will be able to

Today I began to try to make the camera able to center on Earth, I was able to make the center move but it is not
able to move with the planet. I plan to rectify this tommorow if possible. I hope to be able to do a few different things
such as adding layers under the crust of the Earth once I can center the camera on the moving planet.
