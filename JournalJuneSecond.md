Journal June Second
=====

Today I focused on making the speeds of the planets as accurate as possible. I was only able to make Earth and Mercury
accurate. They are moving at the speed that the planets are in real life but it appears much faster because of the scale I used
I might have to scaled the speed if I want to be accurate to life. But I'm not sure if I will do that yet. Next time I hope to fix
all the planets' speeds.
