Journal May Eleventh

Today I was able to make the sun rotate on its axis and then I was able to render mercury even though it was not 
orbiting on the right path, that should only take a little bit of tweaking but that tweaking will require a lot 
of trial and error so it will take a while, I should be able to finish by the end of tomorrow. Hopefully.
